      <h1>Policies and Guidelines for Submissions to the Journal of Economic Psychology</h1>
      <p><i>Note:</i> Elsevier is currently reorganizing and homogenizing the Guide for Authors pages of all their journals. 
      Unfortunately, this means that JoEP's Policies and Guidelines might not always be readily available or up-to-date in Elsevier's pages. 
      The standard, official links are these:</p>
      
      <p><ul><li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-economic-psychology/about/policies-and-guidelines" target="_blank">JoEP's Policies and Guidelines (Elsevier page)</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-economic-psychology/publish/guide-for-authors" target="_blank">General Guide for Authors (Elsevier)</a></li></ul>
</p>
		<p>The Policies and Guidelines will eventually be incorporated in those pages. 
		Until that happens, <strong>the Policies and Guidelines here describe the expectations of the Editors of JoEP and take precedence</strong>.</p>

		<p><a href="#Additional">Additional Guidance</a> in the form of blog posts is also available at the end of this document.</a>

		<p>Please note that this document does not include Elsevier's "General Editorial Policies" which apply to any journal.

<h2><strong>ETHICS IN PUBLISHING</strong></h2> 

<p>Please see Elsevier's information on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231016204830mp_/https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/publishing-ethics#Authors" target="_blank">Ethics in publishing</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>JOURNAL STANDARDS</strong></h2>

<p>Authors submitting manuscripts to JoEP are expected to adhere to the author 
guidelines and to the general standards of the journal, as detailed in this document.
Please read these instructions carefully to avoid desk rejections or unnecessary delays.</p>

<h2><strong>TYPES OF SUBMISSIONS AND LENGTH OF ARTICLES</strong></h2>

<p><i>Note:</i> Unless otherwise stated, all word counts refer to the total text (abstract, main text, references, tables and figures, appendix),
 but not the supplementary (online) materials.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Research Articles</strong> should not exceed 12,000 words in length.</li>
    <li><strong>Review Articles</strong> are focused surveys reviewing some part of the literature. 
    Review Articles and invited pieces can exceed the limit of 12,000 words. 
    However, please note that we do not publish bibliometric surveys: Please see <a href="https://alosferrer.wordpress.com/2021/07/30/surveys-at-joep/" target="_blank">our views on surveys and reviews</a> here.</li>
    <li><strong>Brief Reports</strong> are short research articles, limited to 4,000 words in length (excluding abstract and references). 
Brief Reports include focused reports on single empirical studies, data re-analyses for new purposes, variants of previously-published empirical studies
(especially those published in the journal), and short formal-analytical contributions linked to well-established empirical phenomena.
Brief Reports do <strong>not</strong> include opinion pieces, qualitative studies, or verbal discussions of the literature 
(such contributions are out of the scope of the journal). The introduction of a Brief Report should be concise and refer only to the key related literature.</li>
    <li><strong>Replications</strong> are short, focused articles reporting replications (successful or not) of 
previously-published studies. In general, they should not exceed 4,000 words in length (excluding abstract and references).
The title of such contributions <strong>must</strong> start with "Replication: ..."</li>
    <li><strong>Book Reviews</strong> should be submitted through the journal's online system as any other contribution.
 In general, Book Reviews written at the invitation of the Book Review Editor, but non-invited reviews are also possible. 
 If you are interested in reviewing a book for JoEP, it is advised to contact the Book Review 
Editor (listed in the Editorial Board) in advance.</li>
</ul>

 
<h2><strong>SUBMISSION CHECKLIST</strong></h2>

<p>You can use this list to carry out a final check of your submission before 
you send it to the journal for review. Please check the relevant section
below for more details.</p>

<ul><li>One author has been designated as the corresponding author with contact details (E-mail address and full postal address).</li>

   <li>All necessary files have been uploaded:
   <ul><li>Cover letter (only if necessary: see below)</li>
        <li>Manuscript</li>
        <li>Online Appendix (a PDF file, uploaded as "Supporting File")</li>
        <li>Graphical Abstracts / Highlights files (where applicable; please note that Highlights are <strong>not</strong> required on initial submission)</li>
        </ul>
   <li><strong>Cover letter:</strong> A cover letter is <strong>NOT</strong> necessary.
    Please provide a cover letter <strong>ONLY</strong> if you need to explain extraordinary circumstances contrary to journal policy
    (examples: (i) you cannot make your data publicly available; (ii) you have used deception in your experimental design: (iii) you have not used incentives in your experiments).
    Please do not upload a cover letter to tell us that you are submitting a paper. We know that.
    Please do not upload a cover letter to tell us what the paper is about. That is what the abstract is for.</li>
   <li><strong>Manuscript:</strong> Your article. The first page should include the title, authors' names, affiliations, acknowledgements (in the footnote to the title)
   and any Declaration of Interest statement, and a complete address for the corresponding author including an e-mail address.
   Please also include abstract and keywords in this page.
   Please refrain from adding additional fields- Generally speaking, the title page contains only title, author names and affiliations, and abstract, plus footnotes to those elements.
   That means that everything else should be in an explicit footnote to either the title or the author names.</li>
   <li><strong>Online Appendix:</strong> A single PDF file, uploaded as "Supporting File," with independent pagination and including paper title
    and author names. For experimental papers, this file must contain complete (translated) experimental instructions. 
    For papers using survey data, this file must contain a transcript of the survey questions. 
    Robustness and complementary analyses should also go in this file. 
    Online Appendices are published "as is," unedited, and you are responsible for formatting and providing a readable, platform-independent PDF file.
    <i>"Doc" and "Docx" files are not acceptable. Your paper will be returned to you if you attempt to upload an Online Appendix in doc/docx format.</i>
    Please do not upload multiple Online Appendices, use sections instead. Only one "supporting file" should be provided.</li>
    <li><strong>Highlights</strong> are <i>not</i> required on initial submission, but should be provided before eventual acceptance. 
    We recommend you include them (3 to 5 highlights) only after a revision of the paper is solicited.
    Please note that highlights are short statements, limited to 85 characters in length each, including spaces (this is an Elsevier-wide rule!).</li> 
    <li>For the initial submission, please ensure that all <strong>figures and tables</strong> are embedded in the manuscript file and placed next to the relevant text in the manuscript, rather than at the 
bottom or the top of the file. We do not accept figures and tables collected at the end of the manuscript (and calling them an "appendix" does not allow for an exception).
The captions should be placed directly below the figures or tables. Alternatively, you can provide individual files for figures and tables, but this is not 
recommended at this stage.<br> <i>Note:</i> For accepted submissions, you might be asked to provide individual files for figures. If doing so, please ensure all 
figures (including relevant captions) and all tables (including titles, description, footnotes) have been provided and also ensure all figure 
and table citations in the text match the files provided.</li>
    <li>Manuscript has been spell-checked and 'grammar-checked'. See "Journal Standards" below.</li>
    <li>All references mentioned in the Reference List are cited in the text, and vice versa (we strongly recommend using a bibliography manager package).</li>
    <li>Permission has been obtained for use of copyrighted material from other sources (including the Internet).</li>
    <li>If any of the authors has competing interests to declare, please detail them in a cover letter (expect delays then).</li>
    <li>Journal policies and guidelines detailed in this guide have been reviewed (see below).</li>
    <li>Referee suggestions and contact details provided, based on journal requirements.
     For further information, visit our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231016204830mp_/https://service.elsevier.com/app/home/supporthub/publishing/" target="_blank">Support Center</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    
    
<h2><strong>FORMAL STANDARDS</strong></h2>

<p>The time of editors, associate editors, and reviewers, is just as valuable as that of authors. 
At the Journal of Economic Psychology, papers which have not been exhaustively checked and polished before submission are 
never sent out for reviewing. 
Authors should carefully triple-check (and we mean this literally) their papers before submission to avoid 
typographic, grammar, and formatting errors, ensure that there are no language problems 
(if unsure, please enlist the help of a language editing service or a native speaker),
and generally make sure that the paper is in a highly-polished state. 
For instance, make sure that your bibliography precisely corresponds to your citations and that there are 
no errors in it; if working under LaTeX, please use a bibliographic environment as BibTeX or BibLaTeX.</p>

    
<h2><strong>STATISTICAL STANDARDS</strong></h2>

<p>Authors should ensure that statistical analyses are conducted rigorously and in
 accordance with the highest standards. In particular, the journal 
enforces a number of clear criteria. Failure to comply with them will 
result in desk rejection.</p>

<ul><li>First, the <strong>threshold for statistical significance is 5%</strong> (<i>p&lt;0.05</i>).
Test results with <i>p</i>-values above 0.05 and below 0.10 are <strong>not</strong> "significant at the 10% level" or "marginally significant."
At the Journal of Economic Psychology, they are simply <i>not significant</i>.
As a general rule, non-significant results should not be interpreted. 
Remember: absence of evidence (of an effect) is not evidence of absence.<br> 
In the case of regression tables, use the convention <i>* p&lt;.05 ** p&lt;.01 *** p&lt;.001</i>.<br> 
<i>Note:</i> Your tables, both in the text and in the Appendix, need to state and apply our FULL convention: <i>* p&lt;.05 ** p&lt;.01 *** p&lt;.001</i>.
Please do not omit <i>*** p&lt;.001</i>. Even if nothing is significant at that level, the statement still carries information
(namely that nothing is significant at that level).<br>
In the case of tests, it might be appropriate to occasionally report that a test "missed significance" and report the exact <i>p</i>-value, 
but interpretations of non-significant tests should be avoided in general. See, however, next point.</li>

<li>Second, the journal does welcome the <strong>publication of null results</strong>, where a postulated effect is not found 
(replications, however, should be submitted as such and not as Research Articles: see "Types of Submissions and Length of Articles" above).
However, null effects can only be properly interpreted if a careful power analysis has been carried out before conducting the experiment
and is properly reported in the design section.<br> 
In doing so, please be aware of the distinction between a proper (<i>ex ante</i> or equivalent) power analysis and a <i>post hoc</i> 
(or observed) power analysis. A <i>post hoc</i> power analysis, where one just reports the effect sizes that would have been significant given the 
actual parameters of the study, including actual sample size, is not useful: it simply restates the <i>p</i>-value in other terms. 
In contrast, a proper (ideally <i>ex ante</i>, but not exclusively) power calculation clarifies which effect sizes a study could detect with sufficient power.
This is done through power calculations estimating the probability to obtain a significant effect given a particular effect size (e.g., in 
terms of Cohen's <i>d</i>). The effect sizes are derived from previous studies, theoretical background, or simply the literature standards, meaning 
that power is estimated for large, medium, and small effects, as given in <i>Cohen, J. (1977), Statistical Power Analysis for the Social Sciences, Elsevier.</i></li>

<li>Third, even if a paper does not report null effects, it is necessary to <strong>report how the sample size was determined</strong>. 
This can be part of the power analysis (a sample size of N was computed to be sufficient to detect a certain effect size for given 
alpha and beta values) or refer to the previous literature, but a careful justification is necessary. Independently of power analyses, 
however, please be advised that an article reporting on small-sample studies only is likely to be considered anecdotal and rejected without 
review. Generally, we expect a reasonable number of independent observations and will not publish articles which rely on just a few 
dozens of independent observations. Of course, in some justified cases independent observations are particularly costly (e.g., brain imaging 
studies or market experiments) and the standards for sample sizes are  different. This will be taken into account.</li>

<li>Fourth, if multiple tests are conducted on the same data within a given study, <i>p</i>-values must be adjusted accordingly 
by using the appropriate <strong>corrections for multiple testing</strong> (e.g., Holm-Bonferroni, adjusting the false discovery rate, etc).
For instance, this applies whenever the same hypothesis is tested with several different tests, or when pairwise 
tests of the same hypothesis are conducted among several experimental conditions. It is often not necessary to correct when a few separate, 
different hypotheses are tested, but if multiple hypotheses are tested on the same data set, the likelihood of deriving some erroneous 
inferences increases and adjustments might be needed. If multiple hypotheses all affect the same dependent variable but different 
independent variables, consider a regression analysis instead of an array of separate tests (for conceptually-related regressors, however, 
adjustment might still be needed depending on the exact hypothesis).</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>OTHER RESEARCH STANDARDS</strong></h2>

<p>JoEP also enforces the following standards which might be different in other disciplines.

<ul><li><strong><i>Use of deception:</i></strong>
<br>An issue of particular relevance for the fields of behavioral/experimental
 economics and economic psychology is the use of deception in empirical 
(particularly, experimental) studies. The Journal of Economic Psychology
 will only publish empirical research using deception if the authors can
 and do explain in their manuscript why the use of deception was 
strictly necessary for the purposes of their research.
<br><i>The use of deception and the reasons for doing so should also be detailed in the 
cover letter on initial submission.</i> If, at any point of the editorial process, a paper is 
deemed to have used deception without the authors having explicitly stated it so, the process will be interrupted and the paper will be 
rejected. 
<br>Please note that the reasons for avoiding deception are related to lab credibility and reliability of the data, and not to 
philosophical issues of any kind.</li>

<li><strong><i>Incentivization in experiments:</i></strong>
<br>For experimental work to be published in the Journal of Economic Psychology, the default is that, at least, one of the reported experiments
should show the central effect of the paper in an incentivized setting. Of course, exceptions to this are possible (e.g., providing monetary
incentives dependent on performance might run counter to some research topics or questions). 
However, to avoid an immediate rejection of the manuscript, such exceptions should be explained in the 
cover letter. Studies focusing on the effect of incentives using hypothetical questions only are likely to be rejected without review.</li>

<li><strong><i>Publication of data and materials:</i></strong>
<br>If an experimental or empirical paper is accepted for publication in the Journal of Economic Psychology, it is currently expected that authors 
will make their data, the codes of their statistical analyses (if not straightforward), and the materials of their study publicly available. 
Exceptions are possible but should be justified in advance and explained in the cover letter upon submission. For the publication of data and 
codes, authors might either use Elsevier's own data repository "Mendeley data", or one of the many domain-specific data repositories that are 
being covered by Elsevier's program. More information on data publication can be found at
<a href="https://www.elsevier.com/databaselinking" target="_blank">Elsevier's database linking page</a>. 
<br>Once your data and code are made publicly available, please include explicit instructions on how the readers can download them in the title
 footnote / initial acknowledgments footnote (an explicit footnote to the article's title, in the title page). This should include an actual link
 to the dataset (e.g., a link to an address in Mendeley, osf, etc). This is a prerequisite for eventual acceptance. You can also provide a zip 
file containing data, codebook, and code, to be published as a Supporting File. In this case, your title footnote should explain that data 
and code are available at the journal's webpage. However, we prefer you use Elsevier's Mendeley instead of sending us the data. 
<br>In cases where such an open access to the data and/or to the experimental materials may
 not be possible (e.g., due to third-party rights), this has to be stated and explained in the cover letter accompanying the initial 
submission. However, be advised that the most likely answer will be that we decline to handle the submission.
<br>We encourage authors to already submit the data, the codes, and particularly the experimental materials at the initial 
submission stage (as Supplementary Materials), because often question arise during the review process that are related to the materials or the data.</li>

<li><strong><i>Papers using Survey Data:</i></strong>
<br>If a manuscript describes  data from a survey carried out by the authors, follow the same 
guidelines as for experimental papers (see above) to make the data publicly available. 
<br>If a manuscript uses data from general-purpose surveys or databases, add a short note on the source of the data you 
analyze and how other researchers could gain access to it, even if this requires registration and/or payment. Please do this in the title footnote /
initial acknowledgments footnote, already on initial submission. This is a prerequisite for eventual acceptance.
Please note that submissions using closed datasets that other researchers cannot access will in general be desk-rejected.</li>

<li><strong><i>Disclosure of experimental conditions and variables:</i></strong>
<br>Authors are required to report all implemented experimental conditions (if the 
study is experimental) and disclosed all measured variables, unless 
otherwise reported in the paper or a publicly available appendix to the 
paper. Any deviation from this should be reported in a cover letter. 
Furthermore, authors should report or cite all of the studies that they have run on the research 
question of the paper. If not, they must to outline which additional data on 
this question they have collected in the past, and explain in a cover letter why they did not 
report these data in the current manuscript.</li>

<li><strong><i>Awareness of previous publications:</i></strong> 
<br>We are the journal of the <a href="https://www.iarep.org" target="_blank">International Association for Research in Economic Psychology</a>.
We serve a community and build upon a field. Authors should be aware of articles previously published in the Journal of Economic Psychology on the topic of their manuscript.
Submitted manuscripts should reflect such awareness. Authors are encouraged to review the published issues of the last 2-3 years before submitting, and
to use the search function in the journal's webpage to look for related publications.</li>

<li><strong><i>Citing discussion papers:</i></strong>
<br>Our audience comprises many behavioral and experimental economists, and in 
economics discussion papers are a fully-accepted way to disseminate 
scientific knowledge. Hence, the Journal of Economic Psychology follows 
the conventions in economics with respect to discussion papers. That is,
discussion papers are fully citable, preferably as institutional working papers with details of the working paper series.
The argument that "what is not published (in a journal) should not be quoted" does 
not apply to our journal.</li>

<li><strong><i>Resubmission of previously-rejected manuscripts:</i></strong>
<br>Don't. Rejections are final, even if they happened on the grounds of excessive number of typos or insufficient language proficiency. 
Exceptions to this rule can only be granted by direct invitation by the Editor(s) in Chief, and authors should start an email inquiry on this possibility 
before attempting to re-submit a previously-rejected manuscript. In case a manuscript is discovered to be a resubmission of a 
previously-rejected manuscript, not previously approved by the Editor(s) in Chief, the evaluation process will be terminated regardless of its 
state.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>JoEP STYLE</strong></h2>

<p>JoEP favors a particular, specific style. While we are generally tolerant, deviations from 
the following points might result in your paper returned to you, and if we have to return the paper to you
too often, we might conclude that the distance between your paper and our expectations is too large.</li>

<ul><li><strong><i>Direct, concise style:</i></strong>
<br>We favor a direct, concise, scientific style. Explain what your research is about and how it relates to the appropriate
subfield of research, proceed to describe your experiment or data collection, report your analysis, and conclude. Avoid long, oblique sentences. 
Avoid repeating the same information in different parts of the manuscript.</li>

<ul><li><strong><i>Numbered sections and subsections:</i></strong>
<br>Please number your sections and subsections. Also number your manuscript pages, and your Online Appendix pages. 
If you do not, it will be more difficult to refer to your content in our response and in reviewer reports.</li>

<li><strong><i>Professional formatting:</i></strong>
<br>We expect professional editing and formatting. 
As a courtesy to reviewers, we do not send papers out for refereeing unless they are in a highly-polished state.
Splitting figures and tables across pages, large numbers of typos, low-quality figures, screenshots of tables
instead of tables, etc., are all red flags.</li>

<li><strong><i>Footnotes:</i></strong>
<br>Avoid footnotes as much as possible on initial submission. In any case, avoid long footnotes.
Most footnotes in JoEP papers appear during the reviewing process. Please go through your footnotes. If important, integrate in the text.
If not important, delete. If you keep any, a footnote is one or two sentences, not a paragraph.</li>

<li><strong><i>Citing URLs:</i></strong>
<br>Whenever you cite an online reference, check whether you can refer to an actual scientific or official source.
If citing an online source is unavoidable, make a proper bibliographic entry including "last accessed" data and refer to it as a normal citation.
If this is not appropriate because you are referring to a webpage in itself, e.g. a data collection service, use a bracket in the text. 
Please never give URLs in footnotes.</li>
</ul>
