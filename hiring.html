<h2>PhD Studentship in Neuroeconomic Decision Theory</h2>
		    
<i>Department of Economics, Lancaster University Management School</i>


<p>The Department invites applications for a funded PhD studentship within the nascent field of <b>Neuroeconomics</b>. The post-holder will engage in 4 year, full-time, Economics PhD training from October 1, 2024, under the primary supervision of <a href="http://alosferrer.github.io" target="_blank">Prof. Carlos Al&oacute;s-Ferrer</a>. The studentship covers tuition fees for four years and includes a generous living allowance. The successful candidate will need to have a familiarity with either data analysis or formal-analytical modeling. Programming skills are a plus. Applicants should normally have, or be on track to obtain, an MSc degree in Economics, Psychology, Mathematics, or a related field, but candidates with other quantitative backgrounds could be considered.</p>
<p>The PhD project is interdisciplinary and will require the post-holder to work across disciplines (economics, psychology, decision neuroscience, or mathematics, depending on the post-holder’s background and qualifications). The project is concerned with why and how humans make mistakes in their economic decisions, from the psychological and neural roots of persistent errors to the economic consequences of cognitive failures. It requires a willingness to work with process data, including response times and, potentially, eye-tracking and neural data. The project specifics will be further tailored to the post-holder’s skills and interests and can be more experimental/applied or more analytical/mathematical.</p>

<p>The Economics PhD programme at Lancaster is aimed at high-calibre students who wish to pursue a research career. The Department has a strong group in Behavioural and Experimental Economics and hosts a modern experimental lab (<a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lums/our-departments/economics/research/lexel/">LexEL</a>). It is part of the <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lums/">Lancaster University Management School (LUMS)</a>,  a world-ranked management school that has a reputation for outstanding research. In the UK’s latest Research Excellence Framework, REF 2021, 90% of our research was rated world leading or internationally excellent and we were rated as first for Research Power – recognising the breadth and depth of our work.</p>
<p>The successful applicant will acquire knowledge and skills in economics and psychology, through initial coursework and continuing training, and co-authoring research papers. As PhD student, the post-holder will be supervised by <a href="http://alosferrer.github.io" target="_blank">Prof. Al&oacute;s-Ferrer</a> and other faculty members and have access to advanced research training courses at LUMS and nearby institutions. The post-holder will also be expected to participate in research activities such as the department’s internal/external/PhD seminar series, and interdisciplinary workshops and conferences, both national and international.</p>
