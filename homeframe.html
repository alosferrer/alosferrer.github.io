      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>I am an interdisciplinary researcher between (micro)economics, psychology, and (decision) neuroscience, a Chair Professor of Economics
at <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lums/" target="_blank">Lancaster University Management School</a>,
and Co-Editor in Chief of the <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-economic-psychology" target="_blank">Journal of Economic Psychology.</a>
I have been full professor at the Universities of Zurich, Cologne, and Konstanz, associate professor at the 
Universities of Vienna and Salamanca, and a frequent Visiting Professor at New York University-Abu Dhabi. I am from Spain, speak German fluently, and currently split my time between Switzerland and the U.K.</p>  

<p>My research focuses on understanding and improving human economic decisions, ranging from decisions under risk to strategic decisions (game theory) and voting.
 For that I use decision neuroscience ("neuroeconomics"), behavioral experiments, and mathematical modeling. 
 I maintain a <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/decisions-and-the-brain" target="_blank">"Decisions and the Brain" blog at Psychology Today</a> and 
 a <a href="http://alosferrer.wordpress.com" target="_blank">personal blog at Wordpress</a>. I also co-organize the 
 <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/economicpsychologyseminars" target="_blank">Economic Psychology Seminar</a> of the <a href="https://iarep.org/" target="_blank">IAREP</a>.</p>
